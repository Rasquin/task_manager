 Materialize collapsible (custom name for an accordion)
An accordion expands and contracts when you click on elements of that, so it reveals more detailed information.
And we're using that to display our tasks.
So in the accordion header, or the collapsible header, we'll see the task name and the due date.
And once expanded, we will display the description associated with that task.
